## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### MP3 Conversion Limitations
- Conversion happens entirely in browser memory
- **Recommended**: Videos under 10-15 minutes
- Longer videos may cause:
  - High memory usage
  - Browser slowdown/freeze
  - Conversion failure
- For longer videos, consider:
  - Using "Audio (WebM)" direct download instead
  - Converting with desktop FFmpeg afterwards

### Long Recording Considerations
- Auto-split feature activates at 30 minutes
- Each segment saved separately for stability
- Reduces memory pressure during extended recordings

### Performance Tips
- Close unnecessary tabs before long recordings
- Higher bitrate = larger file size but better quality
- Keep browser window active during recording to avoid throttling

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Recording doesn't start
- Check browser permissions for camera/microphone/screen
- Try refreshing the page
- Ensure you're using a supported browser

### MP3 conversion fails
- Check video length (keep under 15 minutes)
- Close other tabs to free memory
- Try converting shorter segments

### Audio not captured
- Ensure "System Audio" is enabled
- On Windows, select "Share audio" in screen picker dialog
- Some apps may block audio capture (DRM-protected content)

### Memory issues
- Use auto-split feature for long recordings
- Download and clear recordings regularly
- Restart browser if performance degrades
